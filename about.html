        <p>This web application is all about solving one of the major problems that we all face in as a student while moving from one city to another. When we start our college life with all the exitement of moving to another city, there appears a major problem that becomes a big headache for every student. This problem is finding a convinient, compatible and comfortable PG or room of your choice in the local area near your college/university. Moving to a new city which you know nothing about and trying to find a local pg takes a lot of effort and we have to check many houses or areas just to check if there is a pg available or not. moving around a city checking random houses and places for a PG or room is a really tiresome job and causes people a lot of inconvinience. This problem is faced not only by students but also by working bachelors getting transfered from one city to another. Even after using various applications we can not find good PGs in local area and not only PGs but good food is also an unavoidable necesity and it becomes very difficult to find a good mess.
            <br>
        We have also faced the same problems thus we were inspired to build a web application that can help people to find PGs, rooms/flats and mess in local areas near their institution. The application is an interactive application such that a user can register to find a residence of their choice while another can register to uplooad the information of a residence that can be taken by another user. When a user uploads the information of a residence and some other user takes the same residence on rent through the site the the first user who uploaded the information will get some points when a user collects a certain amount of points than he/she will receive a reward from the appication. This helps to develop an interactive environment and also helps to locate locAL residences.  </p>
